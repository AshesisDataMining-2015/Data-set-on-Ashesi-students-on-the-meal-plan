Ashesi University Meal Plan

This project seeks to study the eating pattern and purchases of Ashesi Student on the meal plan.

The datasets used for this project was obtained from my lecturer Dr. Charles Jackson.

Upon exploring the dataset, the following interesting questions would be solved:

1. Which type of meal plan has the most purchases at both cafeteria's(Akorno or Mannies)?
2. Which days of the week has the most purchases and type of food it is at both cafeteria's?
3. Which yeargroup has the most purchases and what type of food it is?
4. Which nationality has the most purchases against the least purchases?
5. Which yeargroup is eating healthy or not?
